Simple CoreData SwiftUI 5.3 example


Tired of searching for simple examples to get you started working with CoreData and a recent version of SwiftUI?

Look no further, this sample project should allow you to familiarize yourself with the basic features and get you running.
This code is not perfect, but it does illustrate how simple it can be.
Also note that we purposely avoided any AppDelegate or SceneDelegate as they are not strictly necessary anymore.

Please make suggestions via issues or submit a PR if you see things that would also be useful to someone getting started with using CoreData in Swift 5.3

This information was created in Sept of 2020 for CoreData with Swift 5.3 on XCode12.2 beta
If you have a newer build environment, please send in any suggestions that would allow this example to stay relevant.
